# TirSu-Writer

An atempt to write a PowerShell Script that creates Tir'su-Symbols of the [Gith Language](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gith_language) of the [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms).

Does it work yet? **Nope, not at all**, it bearly even creates a SVG as a XML-Object. But I've just started, so there's still a lot to be done.

## Why PowerShell of all things?

Simple: I think I have the best chances of actually getting it to work in PS. Since a SVG is nothing more than a special case of an XML-File, juggling the structure is rather straigt forward in PS. And since I have to work with PowerShell often enough for work, I'm used to work with it. Once I've got it working in PS on a level I'm satisfied, I may port it to other environments (I may need some help with that...).
