# TirSu-Writer

An atempt to write a PowerShell Script that creates Tir'su-Symbols of the [Gith Language](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gith_language) of the [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms).

Does it work yet? **Nope, not at all**, it bearly even creates a SVG as a XML-Object. But I've just started, so there's still a lot to be done.
